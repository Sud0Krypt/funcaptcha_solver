## Notes 

Don't bully me for formatting I coded this on replit with a chromebook cuz i felt like it 

If you want to use a new proxy & Session you will need to call the class along with the solve function Example: Funcap(site_key="").solve() # As you can see im calling the class itself along with the function

(this repo will not be updated because I am currently running an active private solution)
